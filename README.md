# Draw

An experiment in using Canvas to create a simple browser-based drawing app.

In its current form, it uses a search engine to grab color palettes from the API of a color-sharing website called colourlovers.com. 

In the future, it may or may not incorporate the following features:

* The ability to take snapshots of the canvas and save them to disk or upload them to social media sites or email them.
* The ability to have two people in different browsers drawing on the same canvas.
* Other fun stuff. Ideas?


## Origin

This project came out of an assignment in the November 2011 Advanced Javascript class taught by Pedro Ha at NYU SCPS. Pedro had created a basic version of the app, and our assignment was to add the API search functionality and also to significantly refactor the code. His original version can be found in the folder "original-files." That code should in no way reflect on his abilities -- it is in a deliberately half-finished state, so that the students could fix it up.


## License

Licenses for Pedro Ha's original version of this app and also for excanvas.js (by Google) can be found in the appropriate folders (see Origin above). The rest is:
